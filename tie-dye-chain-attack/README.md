## Summary
`Tie-Dye Chain Attack` is a poorly-named clone of `Boomshine`, a popular and much better flash game.

In this video, we used the code in this repository to create a simple 2D game, which we asked GPT-5 to reverse via GhidraMCP and 5ire.

This code is free to use and open-sourced under the MIT License.
