## How to Download Individual Project Directories

Oftentimes, you may just want to download one, or only a few, of these Tutorial projects, and not the whole repository.

To do so, you can take advantage of Git's `sparse-checkout` command, as such:

```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/jeFF0Falltrades/Tutorials.git
cd Tutorials
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set master0Fnone_classes/1_x86_Demystified
git pull origin master
```

In this example, only the code files in `master0Fnone_classes/1_x86_Demystified` and its subdirectories will be downloaded onto your machine.

If you want to download multiple directories, you must include them all in your `set` command:

```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/jeFF0Falltrades/Tutorials.git
cd Tutorials
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set master0Fnone_classes/1_x86_Demystified asyncrat_config_parser/
git pull origin master
```

If you omit `master0Fnone_classes/1_x86_Demystified` from the above after cloning it with `sparse-checkout`, for example, it will be removed and only `asyncrat_config_parser` will be present.
