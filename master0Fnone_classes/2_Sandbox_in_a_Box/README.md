# Episode 2: Sandbox in a Box

## Class Objectives

- Build a simple malware analysis lab for FREE, using 2 virtual machines (Remnux and Windows 10) and several free analysis and monitoring tools
- Snapshot our lab and make it exportable so we can bring it anywhere
- Examine some real malware samples in our newly-built sandbox, test out the tools we installed, and discover how to pull indicators of compromise and artifacts for detections and determining what the malware is trying to accomplish
- Challenge you to take what you've learned and use it to achieve an entry on the "Wall of Fame" by analyzing the included "CrackMe" program and finding all the flags!

## Wall of Fame Submission Instructions

1. Download the CrackMe program ZIP (`crackme.zip`) and transfer it into your lab environment (see the video for examples of doing this, if needed), then extract `crackme.exe`
1. Use your lab tools to analyze the file as much as you can
1. Open [this Google form](https://forms.gle/nE2yFZowxhCKBPw37) to input your answers to the challenge questions and provide the name you want on the Wall of Fame
1. Check back a few minutes after your form submission, and the Wall of Fame file in the `crackme` folder should be updated with your name and the date of your achievement
1. Send me an Issue, comment, or message if you did a write-up related to this challenge, and I'll add it next to your name
1. Brag to your friends by showing them your name on the Wall of Fame and then get asked dozens of questions about what any of this means!

crackme.exe SHA256 Hash: `bb203ab338be9968ba5ecbdf1b53633eb15d9be82b7bc32d4e4ade86b3467788`
